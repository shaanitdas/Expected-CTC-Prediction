# Expected-CTC-Prediction
A comprehensive machine learning solution for predicting Expected Cost-To-Company (CTC) for job candidates using ensemble learning techniques with 99.97% accuracy.

üéØ Project Overview
This project predicts the Expected CTC (salary expectations) for job candidates based on their professional profile, educational background, experience, and performance metrics. It uses advanced Ensemble Learning with a Stacking Regressor that combines Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM models.
